This is an backend created for the vidtalk application in playstore.
Implementation details can be found in my medium blog

I am building this to facilitate the exchange of views over youtube videos as posts, this application would help vidtalk in achieving the same.
The comment section is where people exchange views in the current day world, a social network over youtube videos will give more space for people to exchange views, this would also act as a recommendation engine, the only difference is, the videos are not recommended by youtube algorithms but your friends with little more context
